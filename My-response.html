<h3> What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? </h3> 

</p>

<p>
	
Lialina’s has a negative perception of the word “user” and believes that it should be replaced with the word “people”. The term users already recognizes the fact that they are people already engaged in their product and therefore, they focus more on the development of products.

</p>


<p>

On the other hand, the word “people” reminds designers & developers that their users are humans and brings them back into the primary mission: to help people – human beings.

<h3>
What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.

</h3>

<p>
Her view of an ideal internet user is a one who she describes “General purpose user”, inspired by the Universal Machine. The user that only being immersed in their experience without using a social platform and solely focusing on achieving goals, completing tasks and enriching their creativity.  This quality of concentrating on the activity that the computing is helping them and creating a personal experience are the ideal users of the internet.

<h3> From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"? </h3>

</p>

Surprisingly, it was when I was looking up an Airbnb booking in Rome on behalf of my mom. Without any knowledge of Rome, Italy (geographically), I was tasked to book a place near the coliseum. On the webpage, I saw a possible listing with a map on the side to help me locate where listings were. Even though I zoomed into the map and tried to find where coliseum, and there was no way finding out – I didn’t have any geo knowledge about Rome and I was lost in the map. In order to fill in this gap, I opened a new tab and searched the location of the Coliseum and then try to match the visual location of the map back and forth to ultimately find the area that I wanted to book. You would think that such design-focused company as Airbnb might have the perfect usability for users but I was surprised to find out about this gap and eventually found my way to what I wanted from an external resource.
