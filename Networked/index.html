<h1>Cheer Culture </h1>

<p> My favourite time of the year is when there's an international sports competition - Olympics, World Cup, etc.
	</p>

	<p>
	Throughout my life living in four distinct countries, everyone was so passionate about their national teams and created a special cheer.
</p>

	<p>
	In Korea, we had a world cup cheer, in New Zealand we had a rugby team cheer, in Michigan they had football cheer, in Toronto they had basketball cheer. 
</p>

	<p>
	Each country that I lived, I became united with the entire nation under the same cheer and made me feel like I was part of everyone's culture. </p>

	<p>

	I want to relive that moment and create the oneness with every nation's sports cheer!
