<h2> 1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry? </h2></div>

<div class="para2">
<h3> Seu’s ask to “defamiliarize our tool” means that we must the limitations of the technology of tools that we are given today and become less attached to them. Despite the excitement that technology stirs up in our world, at the end of the day, they are tools and it only matters how we can make use out of them, not simply possessing them. We should be asking deeper questions as to “how might we interact with this technology in a conscious and meaningful way?”. We must utilize technology as a new form of language, of communicating, behaving and understanding ourselves better.  </h3>
</div>

<div class="para3">
 <h2>2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.

  </h2></div>

<div class="para4">
<h3> Early Works is one of the poetic tools that was used in the early day of Human-computer Interaction. The beauty of this method is simply shaped by the constraints of the technology, where the speed and unintended interaction of each piece crafts visual attraction for visitors to sit back and watch the entire process. 

<p>

From my exploration, I’ve found https://neuhaus.world (Links to an external site.) which operates within my chosen definition of Early Works. Neuhaus is a participatory & interactive music video based on an artist Jo Goes Hunting. The website on desktop version invites audiences to sit back and watch the camera entering the 3d animated landscape, which was generated by people’s uploaded images. By permitting to upload their image to replace the animated shapes of the website, the music video image may shape differently based on the visitor’s participatory. The element of entering a fully user-participatory space and being able to sit back and enjoy the entire animated journey of the music video is the common elements I found with what Seu described as Early Works. </p>

<p> 

Another website I’ve found which is purely based on the unintended interaction of the audience/user is the https://oio.studio (Links to an external site.). This website is an interaction lab where the visitor can freely hover their mouse over the words and the letters start to destroy, twist, fall apart from each other – which overrides the definition of what we all thought would happen. The unintended interaction excites the visitors to experience more and compels us to hover through all of the letters on the page. And the fact that visitors get to be the “artist” who experiences constraint of not being able to click the link and instead, creating a visual fascination of destructing the letters ties back to my definition of Early Works.  </p></h3>
