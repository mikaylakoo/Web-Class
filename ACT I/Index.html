<div class="question"> 
What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? </div> 


</p>

<p>
	
Lialina’s has a negative perception of the word “user” and believes that it should be replaced with the word “people”. The term users already recognizes the fact that they are people already engaged in their product and therefore, they focus more on the development of products.

</p>


<p>

On the other hand, the word “people” reminds designers & developers that their users are humans and brings them back into the primary mission: to help people – human beings.

<div class="question"> 
What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines. </div>


<p>
Her view of an ideal internet user is a one who she describes “General purpose user”, inspired by the Universal Machine. The user that only being immersed in their experience without using a social platform and solely focusing on achieving goals, completing tasks and enriching their creativity.  This quality of concentrating on the activity that the computing is helping them and creating a personal experience are the ideal users of the internet.

 </p>

<p>

<div class="question">  From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"? </div>

</p>

An example that fills some of the the gaps by the user is one of the first "social media" in Korea called Cyworld. It's one of the earliest versions where you get to create your own homepage or a "diary" and invite your friends and family to come over. When it was first released, they only had basic phot uploading, post skills with some decorative elements for your page. The users got very creative with decorating tools and started uploading their own photography as a background and even their favourite playlist so that it welcomes the visitors of the users' page. As other social medias came along, Cyworld's popularity has faded over the last decade but it was truly provided a creative playground for all users!
