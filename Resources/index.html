<h3> For anything that I could not think of or do not do.. I'd always refer back to W3. But one thing that ticked me the most about w3 is that it thinks that I'm doing the most simple coding...so 70% of the time it wasn't useful, but somehow I found my way to leveraging its vanilla codes into what I wanted to see. So thanks. </h3>

<h3> OHKAY, so I owe a HUGE thank you to this for my last assignment. Thank you developers for uploading all your juicy codes for me to copy and paste and save so much time (of course, I also coded on my own - don't worry Ali). </h3>

<h3> Anytime when I was stuck on a very specific question, and when w3 couldn't solve it (obviously), Stack Overflow was there for me to troubleshoot. THANK YOU so much for being there for me in the darkest times of coding codes that I don't even understand.. I owe you a huge thank you bow. </h3>
